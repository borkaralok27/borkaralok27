# 👋 Hi, I’m Alok!

👨‍💻 I’m passionate about Full Stack Development  
🎓 I completed my MCA from MIT ADT University, Pune in 2025  
🎮 Gaming and reading books are my escape zones  
🛠️ I love solving bugs more than writing code (okay, maybe both 😄)  
💡 Always curious to explore new tech and collaborate on interesting projects
